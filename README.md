### 📁 Importing packages in vanilla javascript, from unpkg, made simple.

---

Just import it from **UNPKG**

```html
<!-- In header -->

<script src="https://unpkg.com/munshi"></script>
```

_or_ using **NPM**

- Install from npm

  ```
  npm install munshi
  ```

- And then, import it

  ```html
  <!-- In header -->

  <script src="node_modules/mushi/index.min.js"></script>
  ```

### ‍💻 Using it is very simple and straightforward as well!

---

```js
/* In your js file or script. */

require("package"); // replace "package" with your package's name
```

#### 🎃 It's as easy as that!

Now you can access all the package's MAIN file's function without any hesitation!
